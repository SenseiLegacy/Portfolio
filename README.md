>**Note**
>#### A note about Project management
> 
> In the size of the projects we have been working on i could throw in a bunch of terms as scrum and agile and thinkboard. My main focus have been on stearing the project and our picture about the project in a uniform line and making sure the feedback we have gotten in playtests have been carefully considered and adjusted for accordingly, aswell as maintaining the happiness and focus of the group.

### Overview
While not implemented as part of a game. I wanted to work on a more fluid buidling mechanic then what most games offer with just the square based snappgrid. Giving a more free rotational option that keeps track of distance to ground (pieces away) and checks for overlapp, snappoints, offset etc. Also my first project in unreal and a work in progress.

### Overview
While it was meant to be a multiplayer rouglike game. Through trial and error and remaking the game everyweek after game tests it ended up beeing a single player game where u swing around 2 characters with a chain aiming to knock out the enemies through trapps and windows while staying alive and delivering a letter of surrender to the enemy king. 

#### My Contributions

Group manegment was a big part for me in this project aswell as working on Enemy AI combat and movement.
